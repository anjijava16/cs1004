Assignment 1 README

Note: you could take a look at the comments if you'd like, because I
basically repeat here what I say in them.

a)
1. I created a scanner (Scanner) to read in the two numbers.
2. Then, I prompted the user for an integer, read it using the Scanner, and
   stored it in num1.
3. After that, I prompted the user for a second integer, read it, and stored it
   in num2.
4. Finally, I printed out, on different lines, the sum, difference, product, and
   modulo of the two numbers.
b)
1. I created six variables: scanner (Scanner), and line0 to line5 (Strings).
2. Then, I prompted the user for five lines of text.
3. After that, I used the scanner to read the lines in and Strings line0 to line5
   to store them.
4. Finally, I printed them out in reverse order.
c)
1. I created variables corresponding to each piece of the requested information
   (i.e. myName, instructorName, myDesiredPerceivedAge, myHomeInstitution,
   courseInstitution, courseName, courseRoom).
2. Then, I printed out, in one full and lengthy sentence (and one
   System.out.println()), the variables in meaningful English.
d)
1. I created a Scanner variable called scanner and one variable of each of the
   primitive types.
2. Then, I prompted the user to enter one of each primitive type, used scanner
   to read each value in (though, since there is no 'nextChar()' method in
   Scanner, I had to just use 'scanner.next().charAt(0)'.), and stored each
   value in each corresponding variable.
3. Finally, I printed the values out on separate lines in the same order.
