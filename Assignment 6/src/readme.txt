Assignment 6 README

a)
	Overview:
		This program takes in the user's line inputs until "done." and then
		prints them all out.
	Running:
		Run this program without any arguments. Then, type in however many
		lines you would like. When you are finished, type "done." (WITH the
		period).
	Notes:
		- I used a Vector to store the user's inputs rather than an ArrayList
		  because Vectors are in general more useful.

b)
	Overview:
		This class has five methods, which do not throw exceptions (rather,
		they just re-prompt the user when the input is invalid) that prompt the
		user for different primitive types. The methods corresponds to all of
		the primitive types except for int (which was already demonstrated),
		boolean, and char.
	Notes:
		- I made Matthew's code shorter (removed the 'int result' declaration
		and the scanner declaration) to make it faster and easier to retype.
