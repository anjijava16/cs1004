a)
main:
1. Prints out "usingEveryThird".
2. Uses everyThird() to print out every third number in the input.
3. Prints out "usingEveryFifth".
4. Uses everyFifth() to print out every fifth number in the input.
5. Prints out "usingEveryThirdOrFifth"
6. Uses everyThirdOrFifth() to print out every third and fifth number in the
   input.

usingEveryThird(int[] args):
	Prints out every third number in the args array.
usingEveryFifth(int[] args):
	Prints out every fifth number in the args array.
usingEveryThirdOrFifth(int[] args):
	Prints out every third and fifth number in the args array.

b)
main:
1. If there are no parameters (i.e. args.length == 0), prints out "No
   parameters entered. Please enter a parameter." and exits with 1.
2. Converts args[0] into an int (assuming it is an int) using
   Integer.parseInt().
3. Otherwise, uses the collatzSequence(args[0]).

collatzSequence(int num):
1. If the parameter is negative, make it positive.
2. If the parameter is zero, do nothing.
3. Outputs the values for the collatz sequence starting from that number
    Prints the number out before changing it.
	If the current number is odd, triple it and add one.
	If the current number is even, halve it.
	Stops when it gets to one.

c)
main:
1. If there are no parameters (i.e. args.length == 0), prints out "Goodbye!"
   and quits.
2. Otherwise, if there are arguments, turns args[0] into an int, using
   Integer.parseInt(args[0]).
3. Runs action2c() with input Integer.parseInt(args[0]).

action2c(int num):
1. If the parameter is 0, outputs "No Zeroes" and returns.
2. If the parameter is negative, multiplies it by -1 and makes it positive.
3. Counts the number of items that would be in the collatz sequence for the
   number.
4. Creates a String array with that length and fills it with the collatz
   sequence.
5. Prints out the array of the collatz sequence data.

d)

STORY: See methods truth() and choice(). They describe the story in detail.

Note: The below is just a summary of what each of the methods do with regard to
      the program/story.

main(String[] args): starts off the program with title();
	Goes to: title() (no choice)

title(): displays the title of the game and initiates introduction();
	Goes to: introduction() (no choice)
	
introduction(): describes the room and introduces computer.
	Goes to: fakeConcussion(), memoryCheck(), checkInjured()

checkInjured(): since person hasn't responded, computer asks again how the
                person is feeling.
	Goes to: fakeConcussion(), fakeEscapePod(), checkInjured()

fakeConcussion(): computer lies about the cause of the concussion person
                  experienced.
	Goes to: fakeEscapePod(), memoryCheck()

fakeEscapePod(): computer lies about the escape pod, and person's discomfort is
                 roused.
	Goes to: memoryCheck()

memoryCheck(): computer asks about person's memory.
	Goes to: rememberedMemory(), memoryLoss()

rememberedMemory(): computer becomes nervous and asks what person remembers.
	Goes to: fakeMemoryImpairment(), memoryLoss()

fakeMemoryImpairment(): computer lies that person's memory has been impaired.
	Goes to: fakeHistory(), skipHistory()

memoryLoss(): computer tells person about memory loss.
	Goes to: fakeHistory(), skipHistory()

fakeHistory(): computer creates a nonsensical story and lies to person about
               the reason person is in the metal cubicle.
	Goes to: idle(), think(), examineWall()

skipHistory(): computer skips the reason person is in the metal cubicle.
	Goes to idle(), think(), fakeHistory(), examineWall()

idle(): person sits around and does nothing, so computer offers to entertain
        person.
	Goes to: entertainment(), rejectedEntertainment()

entertainment(): computer describes what entertainment can be offered.
	Goes to: readStoryEntertainment(), lookAtPicturesEntertainment(),
	         playChessEntertainment(), listenToMusicEntertainment()

readStoryEntertainment(): computer offers to read a story to person.
	Goes to: entertainmentDeath(), rejectedEntertainment()

lookAtPicturesEntertainment(): computer offers to show pictures to person.
	Goes to: entertainmentDeath(), rejectedEntertainment()

playChessEntertainment(): computer offers to play chess with person.
	Goes to: entertainmentDeath(), rejectedEntertainment()

listenToMusicEntertainment(): computer offers to play an album of music
	Goes to: entertainmentDeath(), rejectedEntertainment()

entertainmentDeath(): computer entertains person for over 3 hours, so the
                      ship's shield breaks, and person dies.
	Goes to: N/A (ENDING)

rejectedEntertainment(): person changes mind about entertainment.
	Goes to: idle(), think(), fakeHistory(), examineWall()

think(): person thinks about computer's semi-nonsensical story and gets a hint
         to look at the wall.
	Goes to: idle(), fakeHistory(), examineWall()

examineWall(): person examines the wall and sees what is on it.
	Goes to: escPod(), window(), rations(), AGS(), idle(), think(),
	         fakeHistory()

escPod(): person asks about the door labeled 'Esc. Pod' and receives a suspicious answer.
	Goes to: revealed(), idle()

window(): person asks about what looks like a window and receives a suspicious answer.
	Goes to: lookAtPicturesEntertainment(), revealed(), idle()

AGS(): person asks what "AGS" stands for and receives a suspicious answer.
	Goes to: revealed(), idle()

rations(): person asks about food, and computer answers.
	Goes to: idle()

revealed(): person catches computer lying.
