z) (Assignment 3d Make Up)

	Overview:
		I followed the instructions and created the four methods.
	Notes:
		- For half1(), the program just places the sum from array[0] to
		  array[array.length/2 - 1] (where array.length/2 is truncated) in the
		  variable sum and checks whether the length of the array was even or
		  odd. If it is odd, the program adds array[array.length/2] to the sum.
		- For half2(), the program just returns the sum from
		  array[array.length/2] to array[array.length - 1]. If array.length is
		  odd, array.length/2 is truncated, thereby including the middle
		  element.
		- squares() functions as it should.
		- zeroes() finds the number of 5s and 2s (as factors) throughout the
		  entire array. It then returns the number of 5s or 2s, whichever is
		  less (see comments for more detail).
